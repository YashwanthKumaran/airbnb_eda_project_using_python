# Airbnb Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings to uncover key trends in pricing, availability, and host behavior. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the dataset is cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to provide data-driven insights for Airbnb hosts, travelers, and market analysts.

## Overview
Understanding the Airbnb market requires analyzing large datasets to identify patterns in pricing, seasonal demand, and host activity. This project aims to explore Airbnb listing data through data cleaning, preprocessing, statistical analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights.

## The study focuses on:

Price distribution & influencing factors – How do various factors (location, amenities, reviews, etc.) affect Airbnb pricing?

Availability & seasonal trends – How does Airbnb availability change across different times of the year?

Neighborhood analysis – How do listings in different areas compare in terms of pricing and occupancy?

Host behavior insights – What patterns emerge from host activity, such as listing frequency and response rates?

Outlier detection & data integrity – Identifying anomalies in pricing and booking rates to ensure data accuracy.

By leveraging EDA techniques, this project provides insights to help hosts optimize pricing strategies, assist travelers in making informed booking decisions, and support market analysts in understanding Airbnb trends.

## Objectives
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values and duplicate records.
Standardize formats for accurate analysis.
Price & Availability Analysis

Explore pricing variations based on location, property type, and seasonality.
Identify factors influencing price fluctuations.
Host & Listing Insights

Analyze host activity and performance.
Determine the impact of reviews and ratings on booking rates.
Neighborhood & Location Trends

Compare different locations and their effect on pricing and availability.
Identify popular neighborhoods and trends over time.
Visualization & Data Storytelling

Create clear and interactive visualizations to present insights.
Generate recommendations based on findings.


## Tasks
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Import Airbnb dataset (CSV or other formats).
Check for missing values and duplicates.
Handle missing values by appropriate methods (mean imputation for numeric data, categorical filtering, or removal).
Normalize data formats for consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
Visualize key trends using histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
Analyze relationships between price, location, room type, and availability.
3. Price & Availability Analysis
Plot price distributions across different neighborhoods.
Identify peak booking seasons and trends over time.
Explore the correlation between listing price and customer reviews.
4. Host & Listing Insights
Analyze host activity (number of listings, response rate, and reviews).
Identify patterns in highly rated vs. poorly rated listings.
Determine factors influencing successful listings.
5. Outlier Detection & Anomaly Analysis
Use Z-score and IQR methods to detect extreme price variations.
Identify listings with unusual pricing or availability trends.
6. Data Visualization & Reporting
Generate meaningful charts and graphs using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
Create interactive dashboards (optional) for better insights.
Summarize findings with actionable recommendations.
